As you maybe heard this week at the day 1 keynote of the //Build 2014, Microsoft has announced that WinJS is now open source and available for web applications and not only Windows / Windows Phone apps ! It offers the possibility to develop WinJS apps for other devices than Windows devices. I think the opportunity is really cool <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Sourire" src="https://juliencorioland.blob.core.windows.net/medias/wlEmoticon-smile_2BA665E1.png">

WinJS sources are available [on github](https://github.com/winjs/winjs) and you can use it in your web apps now. It consists in a set of controls like ListView, FlipView, DatePicker, Hub… and more that can be used in simple web applications.

You may find a lot of samples at <a title="http://try.buildwinjs.com/" href="http://try.buildwinjs.com/">http://try.buildwinjs.com/</a>

If you want more information about the WinJS roadmap, you’ll may be interested in watching this webcast from //Build 2014 :
