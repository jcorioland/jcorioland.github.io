# About me

![Julien Corioland](/assets/images/about.jpg)

Hi there! I am a Software Engineer, leaving in Paris and working for Microsoft since 2015. Before that I used to be a consultant for 7 years, mostly on Microsoft/.NET/Azure technologies.

I've always loved software development and sharing my passion for tech either in conferences or on this blog. Before joining Microsoft I have been a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for almost 7 years.

I love to meet new developers and help them to build amazing thing using our tech. You know what? I am a lucky guy because it is what I do at Microsoft every single day. Currently, focusing on Containers, Kubernetes, Microsoft Azure Developer platform services (Azure App Services, Serverless etc...) and DevOps.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jcorioland).

Thank you so much for reading this blog!

Julien
